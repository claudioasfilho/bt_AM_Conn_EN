# SoC - bt_AM_Conn_EN

The Bluetooth example has a custom service and two Custom Characteristics. 

It advertises as **"ConnDev****"**, where the last 4 digits are the two last bytes of the device Mac Address.

It is meant to be used in conjuction to Central device: https://github.com/claudioasfilho/Central_AM 

The Central device writes without response to Data_RX and the Peripheral device writes without response to Central characteristic "AABB".

The Data Held on Data_TX, and also send back to Central has 64 bytes and carries the following information:

**000013DB** FFFF **A79F0052** FFFF **842E1431CB0F** FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF

Bytes 0-3: Counter showing number of 10ms ticks since the start of the connection with Central device         

Byte 6: TX_counter, the number of successfully transmitted packets since reset
Byte 7: RX_Counter, the number of successfully received packets since reset
Byte 8: CRCERR_counter, the number of received packets with CRC errors since reset
Byte 9: FAIL_counter, the number of radio failures, such as aborted TX/RX packets, scheduling failures, and so on. since reset
Details for those 4 registers can be found at: https://docs.silabs.com/bluetooth/4.0/a00028#ga6a5b4be087b9cfe14368a848a4414cef 

Bytes 12-17: Device Mac Address
